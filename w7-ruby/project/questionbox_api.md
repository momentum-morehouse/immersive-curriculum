QuestionBox API
===============

## Skills

## Description
Modify your QuestionBox application and add API functionality to it. You'll work on this weekend project with your existing QB team.

Your application can still work as it currently does, but it should respond to requests for JSON data in addition to serving HTML and it should incorporate token-based authentication. Some endpoints for your API should be freely available, but for creating and editing capabilities, api users will need to be authenticated.

The API should allow all the same CRUD functions that the original application does, with the exception of creating a new user via the API.

Your first order of business should be sketching out the endpoints for your application and the design of the data you will return.

Please submit complete documentation for using your API in the README for your application.

## Extra Challenges

 - Implement authentication using a gem like [OmniAuth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth), [Doorkeeper](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper), [AuthLogic](https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic), or [Devise](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth).
- Allow users to register as a new user via the API.
