Review: The Request-Response Cycle
===================================

## Exercise

You've been building Rails applications for a while now. As we start designing APIs, let's make sure we understand the foundation we're building on.

With a partner, outline the request-response cycle in a Rails app, beginning with a URL typed into a browser address bar to the page loading in the browser.

For example, use the following three URLs:

1. /
2. /gifs
3. /gifs/23463-cats-typing-on-keyboards

Consider all the parts of a Rails application that are involved, in what order, and how it works together. You can do this at a fairly high level.

## Outcome

Be ready to do a 5-minute presentation on this process. Explain it as you would to students in this class, as you were in week 4 when you were first introduced to Rails.
