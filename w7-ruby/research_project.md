# Technical topic presentations

## Details

Research and present a technical topic in class. Start by Googling to learn more about it. You'll spend time reading up on the topic, learning why it's important and what a Ruby on Rails developer should know about it. You'll share what you've learned in class next week, following homework review.

Prepare a 15-20 minute presentation on your topic, including a code demo. **You do not need to prepare slides or a Powerpoint** but you are not prohibited from doing so.

The topics are intentionally broad. You can narrow them down or expand upon them to include other things as you see fit. This is your time and your topic.

The goal of this assignment is to give you practice doing research and speaking about a technical topic. Your audience for this topic will be our class -- in other words, your colleagues.

Guidelines for your talk (you don't need to do all of these things, but you will need to do most of them to cover your topic effectively):

- Give an overview of your topic in simple language
- What is interesting about your topic to you?
- Why is it important or useful to know about?
- Explain how your topic fits in with, extends, or complements what we have already done in class
- Outline and explain the concepts that are essential to understand about your topic
- Explain any gotchas or confusing things about it
- Make a recommendation for how your fellow developers can get started with / apply the concepts you are talking about
- Show some code to demonstrate your topic. Options for this include:
  - You can show code you wrote or code you found online, as long as you can explain it as if you yourself had written it
  - You can write code on the whiteboard or show it in your editor on the projector
  - You can try live coding!
- List some questions that you have that you'd like to follow up on when you have time
- Be ready to answer questions as best as you can at the end of your presentation
- Please provide a list of references for your topic. You are welcome to consult books, and any links you have will be added to the student knowledge base.
