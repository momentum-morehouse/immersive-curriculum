## Skills
TODO

## Description
Users of your application should be able to search previous questions and answers for keywords and phrases they're interested in. Implement full-text search capabilities in QuestionBox.

This feature should be fully developed, including a user interface. Give some thought to incorporating this feature in a way that takes user experience into account.
