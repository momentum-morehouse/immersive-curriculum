## Description

Create a single-page Rails app which looks like your GitHub Profile page.

## Instructions

Create a new Rails app with one controller and one view.  Make it look as much like your GitHub profile page as possible.  Here's an example link to a GitHub profile page:

https://github.com/masonfmatthews

The primary purpose of this exercise is to get a Rails app to display HTML styled with CSS.  Feel free to copy what you find when you "View Source" on your GitHub Profile page, then paste it into the right place in your new Rails app.

If you complete this exercise, turn off your WiFi, hit refresh, and see what it looks like.  Then see if you can fix it.
