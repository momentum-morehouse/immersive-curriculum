# Yay, you're on Rails!

## Description

As you progress in your Rails knowledge, [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org) is a site you will visit often. For this assignment, read the introductory article, [Getting Started with Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html),following along with the code examples (read the code!).

Build the blog application described in the article.

Along the way you'll encounter aspects of Rails that you have not yet seen in class. Just keep going and record your questions about these aspects so that you can ask them in project review.
