# GitHub Profile Page

## Description

Recreate your own GitHub profile Repositories page (with real, live data) in a Rails application. Use GitHub's public API.

To do this, build a very simple Rails application which consumes information from the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and presents it from a Rails view. Your home page should look as much like the GitHub profile repositories page as possible. Here is an example link to the repositories page:

https://github.com/sarahmei?tab=repositories

This page has a lot going on, from styling to navigation bars to icons. You will need to prioritize and make decisions about what to implement. As you're selecting sections of the page to work on, keep in mind that the most important part is for the information on the page to be accurate and pulled from the API.

Your Rails application will not need to have any database tables, since we are not going to persist any data.

The search and filter functions and the create a new repository button do not need to be functional.

When feasible (meaning, don't spend a lot of time making this work), links on your page should work and go to the real pages on github.com.
