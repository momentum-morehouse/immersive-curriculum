# Yay, you're on Rails!

## Description

As you progress in your Rails knowledge, [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org) is a site you will visit often. For this assignment, read the introductory article [Getting Started with Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html), following along with the code examples (_read the code! run the code!_).

Your assignment is to follow the steps to build the blog application described in the article.

Along the way you'll encounter aspects of Rails that you have not yet seen in class. Just work your way through and try to pick up as much as you can. Tinker with the code, change things, see what works and what breaks, read error messages. Pay special attention to any output in the terminal window.
