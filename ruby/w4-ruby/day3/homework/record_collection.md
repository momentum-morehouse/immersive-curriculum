# Rails Record Collection

## Description

Create a new Rails application to keep track of all the music albums you own. You can choose what fields each album should have, but you should have at least these three:

- Title
- Artist Name
- Year Released

Your Rails app should allow you to do the following:

- See all albums
- Make a new album
- See an existing album
- Edit an existing album
- Delete an existing album

Try to do this assignment without generating scaffolds! You can use other rails generators, however.

### Extra Challenge

Use the `bootstrap-rubygem` gem to include Bootstrap in your Rails app and use it for styling.
