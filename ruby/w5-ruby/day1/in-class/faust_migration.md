# Mallory Furniture

## in class, pair programming

Mallory Furniture is expanding with multiple locations! They now have warehouses for their products: there is a North warehouse, a South warehouse, and a West warehouse. Each item will be located in one of those three locations, and the database needs to track that.

Alter the existing Mallory furniture database with migrations to account for that business development. Consider what code changes need to be made to account for this difference.
