# CreatureTracker App


## Description

For this project you will build an api-only application that lets a single user log creatures they are tracking, what they want to track, and keep notes about each creature. Be as creative as you want to be with this: it might be a birding log, a list of dinosaurs, a Pokemon journal...

Basic CRUD functions should be available via your API: an api user should be able to retrieve a creature or note, add an entry for a new creature or note, and delete a creature or note. If you finish that, implement the functionality to edit creatures and notes and search for a creature based on url params.

** Models **
A creature should have at least a name and/or a species (or a common name and a scientific name...you get the idea) and a status (this is up to you, but consider something indicating whether it has been seen or not yet seen).

A user should have the ability to add descriptive notes for each creature. A note should have at least a body.

The level of complexity is up to you, but plan to start small and be able to add features later on.

Please include some seed data.

Implement the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/creatures` - return all creatures as JSON
- `GET /api/creatures/:id` - return an individual creature as JSON
- `POST /api/creatures` - create a new creature, return success/failure status code
- `DELETE /api/creatures/:id` - delete creature, return success/failure status code (this should delete all the associated notes as well)
- `GET /api/creatures/:id/notes` - return all notes for an individual creature
- `POST /api/creatures/:id/notes` - create a new note for a creature, return success/failure status code
- `DELETE /api/creatures/:id/notes/:id` - delete a note, return success/failure status code

Ensure that you return proper success/failure HTTP status codes based on the user input and results. For example, return a `200` status code if the operation was successful, `201` for created resource, or `404` if a resource with a given id cannot be found. See [httpstatuses.com](https://httpstatuses.com).

## Extra Challenges

### Edit creatures and notes

Implement endpoints to accept updated data for creatures and notes:

* `PUT /api/creatures/:id` - update a creature, return success/failure status code
* `PUT /api/creatures/:id/notes/:id` - update a note, return success/failure status code

### Implement searching, sorting, and filtering for `creature` resources

Modify the `GET /api/creatures` endpoint to support filtering, searching, and sorting resources by using query string parameters.

Implement the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/creatures?name=creatureName` - return all creatures that match a name query string
- `GET /api/creatures?seen=1` - return all seen creatures as JSON
- `GET /api/creatures?unseen=0` - return all unseen creatures as JSON
- `GET /api/creatures?sort=priority` - return all creatures as JSON sorted in some meaningful way, by priority, created/updated date, completed status, etc.s
