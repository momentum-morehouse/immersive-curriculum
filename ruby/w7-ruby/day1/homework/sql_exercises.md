# SQL Queries!

## Description

For each of the questions below, add the following information to a Markdown file in your homework repo:

- The original question text
- Your final SQL query (which you must have run and validated on the included database)
- The number of results returned (if more than one)
- The specific result returned (if a single record is returned)

## The queries

- Find all time entries.
- Find the developer who joined most recently.
- Find the number of projects for each client.
- Find all time entries, and show each one's client name next to it.
- Find all developers in the "Ohio sheep" group.
- Find the total number of hours worked for each client.
- Find the client for whom Mrs. Lupe Schowalter (the developer) has worked the greatest number of hours.
- List all client names with their project names (multiple rows for one client is fine).  Make sure that clients still show up even if they have no projects.
- Find all developers who have written no comments.

Unless otherwise specified, return all columns in the requested table (e.g. developers).

## Challenges

Try these queries if you have time:

- Find all developers with at least five comments.
- Find the developer who worked the fewest hours in January of 2015.
- Find all time entries which were created by developers who were not assigned to that time entry's project.
- Find all developers with no time put towards at least one of their assigned projects.
- Find all pairs of developers who are in two or more different groups together.
