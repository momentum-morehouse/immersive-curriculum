# Adding an Admin Dashboard

Using either ActiveAdmin or Administrate, add an admin dashboard to any previous application you've built in class.

The dashboard should let admin users manage the data of your application in a UI.

For the first step of this assignment, design the admin dashboard. What do you want your admin users to be able to do?
When you know what your project specs are, implement the dashboard.

Your homework submission should be a README explaining what you decided to do, including a link to the project repo that you added the admin dashboard to. Please also include a screenshot of the admin dashboard main page to illustrate your README.
