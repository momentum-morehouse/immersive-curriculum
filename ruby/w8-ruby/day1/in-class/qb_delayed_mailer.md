QB Welcome Email with Active Job
=================================

Work on this in your QB group.

Your QB application should already be sending a welcome email to users when they register. Modify that feature to send the welcome email using a background job, instead of sending it right away.

See [this blog post](https://ryanboland.com/blog/writing-your-first-background-worker/) for help.
