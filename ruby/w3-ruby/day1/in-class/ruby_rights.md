# Ruby Rights

### Requirements

With your partner, write a short Ruby program that executes on the command line. It should take user input and return output to the command line.

Create a Ruby file which you'll run from the command line. For instance: `$ ruby legal_age.rb`

Checklist

- Write a method called `check_age` that is called every time the script is run.
- When it runs, the program asks the user for their age. It then tells them what rights they have gained based on their age.

  - 16 or older, they can now get a driver's license.
  - 18 or older, they can now vote.
  - 21 or older, they can now order a drink in a bar.
  - 25 or older, they can now rent a car.
