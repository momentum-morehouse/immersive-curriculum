# Ruby Classroom

## Directions

This project requires you to write a set of functions that use hashes and arrays to calculate various statistics for a classroom. Almost all of these functions will take the same data structure, a hash of grades, which looks like this:

```ruby
{
  indiana: [94, 82, 59, 95, 55, 98, 93, 84, 81, 75],
  nevada: [53, 84, 98, 58, 75, 61, 67, 62, 60, 89],
  drew: [88, 55, 76, 66, 57, 57, 62, 89, 67, 76]
}
```

There are tests provided to help you test that your functions are correct. Make these tests pass.

### Files

The functions are located in `classroom.rb` in the 'starter\_files' folder. To run the tests to see if your code is correct, run `ruby classroom_test.rb`.
# Ruby Classroom

## Directions

This project requires you to write a set of functions that use hashes and arrays to calculate various statistics for a classroom. Almost all of these functions will take the same data structure: a [hash](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Hash.html). This hash contains student names and grades, and looks like this:

```ruby
{
  indiana: [94, 82, 59, 95, 55, 98, 93, 84, 81, 75],
  nevada: [53, 84, 98, 58, 75, 61, 67, 62, 60, 89],
  drew: [88, 55, 76, 66, 57, 57, 62, 89, 67, 76]
}
```

Tests are provided to help guide you as you write your ruby code. You'll need to write ruby methods to make these tests pass.

### Files

Write your methods in `classroom.rb` in the 'starter\_files' folder. There are comments there to help you get started. To run the tests to see if your code passes or fails, run `ruby classroom_test.rb`.
