# Week 9: Review and Refactor

This week's task is to begin tying things up and preparing to start your final project.

Your homework each day will include some percentage of the following. How you allocate your time is up to you.

- work on your portfolio
- previous project refactoring
- supplemental reading/videos

## Work on your portfolio

Whatever needs doing.

## Refactor a previous project

Take a project you worked on for a weekend or daily assignment and spiff it up in readiness for going on the job market or for inclusion in your portfolio. Maybe you never got it working, or it just needs to be cleaned up a little. Maybe you didn't have time for extra challenges, but you do now.

## Read/watch supplemental material

I've pulled together some material on various topics that I think you'll find useful. If you have time for it, great. If not, add to your bookmarks for reference later. Links will be added to the KB for this week.
