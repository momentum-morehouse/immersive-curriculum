## Directions

In this homework, you will practice using Git to put your code on GitHub.

For each previous project:

1. Download your previous project from Thimble.
1. Unzip your project into a new directory.
1. Make this directory a Git repository.
1. Create a new repository on GitHub for the project.
1. Add the GitHub repository as a remote called "origin" to your local repository.
1. Commit your project code.
1. Push the code to GitHub.

When done, submit links to both of your GitHub repositories.

### Git Immersion

After you have completed putting your previous projects on GitHub, go to [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/). You should walk through these exercises before Monday. When it asks you to install Ruby, run `brew install ruby`.
