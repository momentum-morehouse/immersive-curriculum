# Currency converter

## Description

Create a set of functions to convert currency from one denomination to another.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should understand:

- Test-driven development

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

- Raise exceptions
- Write detailed tests
- Break down programming problems into smaller ones

## Details

### Deliverables

- A Git repo containing at least:
  - `README.md` file explaining how to run your project
  - a `currency` module
  - a `test_currency` set of tests

### Requirements

- Passing unit tests
- No PEP8 or Pyflakes warnings or errors
- No functions longer than 7 lines of code
- 100% test coverage

## Normal Mode

Use test-driven development to design a function called `convert`. Below is a list of all the things it should do. In order to complete this exercise, follow these directions:

- For each requirement, write a test first, and then make the test pass.
- Every time you finish a requirement, commit your code with a message describing the requirement.
- Go through the requirements one-by-one. Do not skip around.

### Steps:

- Create a function called `convert` that takes a dictionary called `rates`, a number called `value`, a string called `from`, and a string called `to`. Make sure than when you call `convert` with `from` and `to` being equal, the return value is the same as `value`.

- The `rates` dictionary should contain a list of tuples, with each tuple containing a currency code you can convert from, a currency code you can convert to, and a rate.

  ```py
  [("USD", "EUR", 0.74)]
  ```

  This means that each dollar is worth 0.74 euros.

  `value` is the amount of currency, `from` is the current currency code, and `to` is the currency code you wish to convert to.

  Given the above rates, make sure that converting 1 dollar into euros returns the following value: `0.74`.

- Next, test that you can convert currency with a `value` that is not 1.
- Next, test that converting 1 euro into dollars returns `1.35` (or an approximation).
- Create a new list of rates with two or more tuples. Make sure you can convert both ways with each rate. For example, with these rates:

  ```py
  [("USD", "EUR", 0.74), ("EUR", "JPY", 145.949)]
  ```

  Make sure you can convert from USD to EUR, EUR to USD, EUR to JPY, and JPY to EUR.

- Make sure that if you try to make a conversion you do not know about, a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate message.

## Hard Mode

In addition to the requirements from **Normal Mode**:

- Test that you can convert between any two rates that have a currency they can convert to in common, even if you do not have a direct conversion rate for them. For example, with the rates:

  ```py
  [("USD", "EUR", 0.74), ("EUR", "JPY", 145.949)]
  ```

  Make sure you can convert from USD to JPY.
