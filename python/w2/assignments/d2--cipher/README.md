# Caesar cipher

## Description

Using a set of provided classes, create a program to encrypt text using a Caesar cipher and decrypt previously encrypted texts.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should understand:

- How classes define methods for their objects

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

- Create an instance method
- Call instance methods

## Details

### Deliverables

- A Git repo containing all the provided starter files completed to make this program work.

### Requirements

- Tests in `cipher_test.py` pass
- No PEP8 or Pyflakes warnings or errors

### Normal Mode

Read the classes `Message`, `PlaintextMessage`, and `CiphertextMessage`. Using the docstrings included, complete these classes. Upon completion, the tests in `cipher_test.py` should pass.

### Hard Mode

Use the `argparse` module to create a command-line interface for `cipher.py`, allowing a user to encrypt and decrypt messages using it.
