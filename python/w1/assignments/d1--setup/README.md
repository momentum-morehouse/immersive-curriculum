# Git and command line practice

## Description

You will ensure you have everything installed that you need, get practice using the command line, and use Git.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should understand:

- The basics of how to use Git
- What directories and files are

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

- Install software using Homebrew
- Stage, commit, and push files using Git

## Details

First, ensure [you have set up your Mac correctly by following these directions.](https://github.com/momentum-cohort-2018-10/kb/blob/master/mac-setup.md)

After you have done that, create a file called `output.txt` in this repository. On the command line, run the following commands:

```
$ brew --version
$ python3 --version
$ pipenv --version
```

Copy each of these and their output from your terminal and paste them in `output.txt`. Add this file to the repo and commit it.

### Git-it

Next, install [Git-it](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron), a tutorial program that will walk you through the basics of Git and GitHub. To install it, run:

```
$ brew cask install git-it
```

This should put the Git-it program in your `/Applications` folder.

Git-it will tell you to install Github Desktop. You **do not** have to install this, although you can if you want.

When you try and run Git-it, you may get a notice that the application is from an unknown developer. If so, right-click on the application and then choose "Open." You will be presented with a dialog -- choose to run the application.

Once running, complete the tasks in Git-it.

### What do I do if I've completed all of the above?

You're done! The first day can be easy for some people and hard for others. Help out a classmate. If you really want more to do, check out [Introduction to Programming with Python](https://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/index.html) and get a head-start on tomorrow.
