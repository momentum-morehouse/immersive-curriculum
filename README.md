# Momentum Curriculum

This is the repository for all lesson plans and example code.

Assignments should be in the [Momentum Assignments](https://github.com/momentum-assignments) organization and linked from there to lesson plans.

This project uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate HTML. See [docs/](docs/) for the content.
