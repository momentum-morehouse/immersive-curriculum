## Directions

Your project today is to build a single-page application that displays books using React. You should use `create-react-app` to create the application and build up from there.

The page should display a list of books with a thumbnail display of information for each book,
including:

+ title
+ author
+ short description
+ image of the book's cover

When the information for that book is clicked, the section expands to show additional information about the book. When it is clicked again, it should collapse back to the original view. This behavior is commonly referred to as an accordion, like [this component in Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/collapse/#accordion-example).

The additional information shown in the expanded view should include:

+ url
+ publisher
+ publication date
+ expanded description

Note that you will need to handle cases where not all the data is available. In these cases, make sure your UI design can accommodate missing data and/or supply placeholder images or text, as appropriate.
