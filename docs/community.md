# Establishing the Community of the Classroom

## Objectives

- Welcome students and set expectations.
- Establish classroom and community norms.
  - Students have a voice in the classroom.
  - It is a safe place to ask questions and risk doing something you may initially fail at.
- Create a group agreement that will serve as guidelines for the community for the duration of the program.

## Exercises

### Circle Practice: Introductions

Ask students to arrange their chairs in a circle (the instructor is part of the circle). Open the circle by welcoming students and asking each person to say their name and why they decided to learn to code

### Group Agreement Generation

A group agreement serves as a founding document for how our community will work and be together. It reflects the needs and values of each team of students that come together to learn and work.

We generate an agreement together through a series of exercises that require each person to contribute to the substance and wording of the agreement and to give their individual assent to it.

Supplies: a good quantity of sticky notes and pens
Time: plan for one hour

- To begin, ask students a question or a series of questions that will get them thinking about the norms they would like to establish for the group. You can write this up on a whiteboard or a slide so students can reference it.
- In 5 minutes, each person responds by writing an answer -- a word or phrase -- on a sticky note. One idea per sticky note, but no limit on the number of notes.
- At the end of 5 minutes, each student reads what they wrote and sticks their notes up on the whiteboard.
- We review what we have generated on the sticky notes and group them by theme.
- Put students in groups and ask them to write one or more sentences that encapsulate the ideas on the note.
- Write those sentences on the whiteboard. Ask clarifying questions if needed to shape the sentence into a positive, clear statement.
- When you have a list that reflects the input of everyone, this is the group agreement. Take a picture and transcribe it so it can be shared.
- Ask each person individually if they agree.
- The agreement requires positive verbal assent from each person, so be ready to make changes to the agreement as needed to achieve this.

#### Remote alternative

If class is meeting over Zoom, you can do the same activity using the remote tools.

- You can put participants in breakout rooms for discussion.
- You can ask participants to use the chat feature instead of sticky notes to write their comments.
- The feedback tools available to each participant have a YES or NO option to allow people to agree or disagree.


#### Questions to ask

- What would make this group work well for you?
- What makes this a safe and respectful place for us to work in?
- What would make this group a good space for learning?
