# JavaScript Objects

## Objectives

- Recognize and use objects to store, change, and retrieve values

- [assignment repo](https://github.com/momentum-assignments/js--customer-database)

## Lecture notes

The most important things for students to know:

- Objects are a collection of keys and values
- Use objects to collect different data about one thing; arrays for multiple things
- Object keys are strings; object values are anything -- including arrays, other objects, and functions
- Object values can be retrieved with dot-notation or bracket-notation.
  - Bracket notation is good for dynamic lookup or weird keys
