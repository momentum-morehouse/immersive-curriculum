[Command line lecture notes](notes-command-line.md)

[Git lecture notes](notes-git.md)

## Objectives

Students should be able to...

- Use the terminal to navigate the file system, manipulate files, and use git
- Understand relative and absolute paths and have some understanding of `$PATH`
- Use programs on the command line (e.g. `cat`, `man`, `brew`, `curl`)
- Understand what version control is and why we use it
- Understand enough of the concepts of git to start using version control in daily assignments, including `init`, `clone`, `status`, `add`, `commit`, and `push`

## Assignment

- Read Tracy Osborn's [Really Friendly Command Line Intro](https://hellowebbooks.com/learn-command-line/)
- Complete the [Git-it tutorial](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron)

## Demo ideas

- Use the terminal to demo shell commands and git
- Demo using local repos with GitHub remote (creating a repo on GitHub and cloning it, or connecting an existing local repo; forking a repo; pushing up to GitHub)

## Exercise ideas

- Have students explore their file structures using the command line
- Create, delete, move/rename, copy files and directories
- Ask students to experiment with several of the demoâ€™d utilities (eg, man pages, cat, cal)
- Ask students to create a local repo and push it to GitHub. Have them make changes and push more than one commit.
