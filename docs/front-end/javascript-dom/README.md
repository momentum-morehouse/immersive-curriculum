# JavaScript and the DOM

## Objectives

Students should be able to:

- select DOM elements for manipulation
- add and remove DOM elements dynamically
- write functions that respond to click events

## Assignment

- [Calculator](https://github.com/momentum-assignments/js--calculator)

## Lecture notes

- explain how the browser parses HTML to create the DOM and renders the page

Most important things for students to know:

- How to select elements with `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`
- How to add and remove classes from elements using `classList`
- How to create new elements with `createElement` and put them into the DOM with `appendChild`
- How to remove elements
- How to alter the `innerHTML` of elements
- How to attach and handle `click` events

## Demo ideas

- [Glitch demo of dom manipulation and event listener](https://glitch.com/~bear-messages)

## Exercise ideas

These are documented like exercises but could also be used as demos.

- [DOM manipulation: display data on the page (event handler included)](https://glitch.com/~dom-de-dom-dom)
- [DOM manipulation: show/hide on click](https://glitch.com/~dom-de-dom-dom-2)
