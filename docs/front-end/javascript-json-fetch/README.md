# JavaScript: JSON and the Fetch API

## Objectives

Students should be able to:

- Create, store, and retrieve data using JS objects
- Make requests with a client like Insomnia to GET data
- Make and receive GET requests using the Fetch API and display that data on a page
- Understand the basics of the HTTP request/response cycle, including verbs and status codes

## Assignment

Using the GitHub API GET data to create a GitHub profile page

## Lecture notes

The most important thing for students to know:

- JSON is a format for transporting data between programs
- JSON *is not* JavaScript. It is a very strict subset.
- JavaScript can make "requests"
- These requests are the same as the ones your browser makes when you go to a page
- `fetch` is how you make these requests
- `fetch` returns something called a promise. What you need to know is how `.then` works on a promise, and why you use it instead of `fetch` returning a value
- `.then` after a fetch gets a *response*
