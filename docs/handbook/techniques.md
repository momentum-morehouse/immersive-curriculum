# Teaching techniques

## Engage student voices

One of our overarching goals in the classroom is to make sure each student is engaged and learning. We do that by emphasizing each student's voice.

### Use positive assent

When you introduce expectations for the classroom, what you'll be covering, or giving an assignment, get positive assent from the class. That is, ask them directly if they agree, and leave room for their input.

This is particularly important on the first day when you're explaining how the class will work. Explain your expectations, get group input, make a group agreement, and then get everyone to assent.

### Call on students directly

When we ask for anyone to answer, we get the same students over and over. The students most comfortable volunteering an answer are the ones who need practice the least. The students who don’t answer often don't feel like they have a voice in the classroom. Asking them directly gives them a voice.

This doesn’t just apply to asking questions, but asking for what questions people have. When you are opening the floor to questions, start by asking a specific student what questions they have.

Keep a record of who’s spoken. Use this to determine who to call on next.

### Ask students direct questions

Open-ended questions are great once students are experienced, but at first, they need questions that are more focused in on what they can see and have just heard in class. Some great questions to use early on:

* Which of these two options would you choose? (after showing two approaches)
* What does this code do? (after showing a small snippet of code)
* Can you find the bug in this code? (after purposefully or accidentally introducing a bug)
* What function/CSS property/HTML tag do we need to complete this task?

### Set students up to win

Make sure the questions you ask are within students' capabilities. Directly asking students questions they can't answer doesn't build confidence. In early weeks, for example, ask either/or questions. Which option is better? Will this work? In later weeks, ask open-ended questions.

When you get a wrong answer, look for the right in it. If you can see the misunderstanding, point out why the student might have answered that, and then gently move toward the right answer. Never dismiss a student answer.

For harder, more open-ended questions, put students in dyads or triads to discuss and then come back with answers.




## Emphasize the practice of programming

Programming is what we at Momentum call a "practice skill." Like playing an instrument, cooking, or painting, you get better at it by doing it, even and especially when you aren't very good at it.

### Prefer live code over static examples

Showing slides or static examples is good for introductions, but once you're past introducing the concept, write code in front of the class. It is ok if you make mistakes! Students will learn from those too, as they see how to go about fixing errors.

### Pair with the class

As you write code in the class, engage the class like you would a pair programming partner. Always explain your thought process as you're writing code; don't just say what you're writing, but why you're writing it. Likewise, make sure to turn to the class often to ask how they would approach a task, or if they have input on your code.

As usual, pause often for questions, but first and foremost, treat the students as partners in creation.

### Have students explain code

After you write code, you can call on a student to explain it. Even if you've just explained it, this "teachback" technique can be incredibly helpful.
