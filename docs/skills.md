# Skill Assessment

We rate all skills taught on a four-point scale of understanding on that skill, with the following template as our guideline.

1. Recognition
2. Creation from a template
3. **Use skill/topic in appropriate context and explain decisions**
4. Full understanding

We hope for level 3 with each student on each topic by the end of the course, with the understanding that level 2 is reasonable.
