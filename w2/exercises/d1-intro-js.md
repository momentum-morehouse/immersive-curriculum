Work together to answer the questions in the javascript file.

Before you run any code, discuss what you think the results will be, then test your hypothesis by running the code in a javascript console.

If you don't get the results you expect, discuss what you think is going on. Write down any observations about unexpected results or questions that you have, and we'll discuss together as a class.
