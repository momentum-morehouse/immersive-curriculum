# Intro JS: functions

Create a javascript file and link it to an html page so that you can run these functions in the console.

1. Write a function that takes a single argument and then logs that argument to the console.

2. Write a function called `sum` with two parameters that returns the sum of those 2 numbers.

3. Write a function called `getLength` that takes one argument (a string) and returns its length

4. Write a function that takes a character as an argument (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.
