# Weather App

 ## Directions

Build a React application that lets users see weather data for a location of their choice.

The page should display a form asking for a city and state input. When they submit the form, your page should display current conditions for that location.

Form input should be validated. For weather data, use the [Weather Underground API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs). You will have to sign up for an API Key, but the free tier of their service will be sufficient for our purposes.

Once you get the basic functionality working, see if you can implement at least one of the extra challenges.

## Extra challenges

- Create views that can show the hourly forecast and a 10-day forecast.
- Include a date input in your form so that you can request and display historical weather information.
- Use a font icon library to display icons that illustration weather conditions.
