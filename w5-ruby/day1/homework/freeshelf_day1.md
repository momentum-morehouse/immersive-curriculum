## Description

During this three-day project, you will build a Ruby on Rails application to collect an index of free programming books online. This application will, after three days, allow users to look at the index, add new books, edit or remove books they added, and checkout books.

On the first day, your application should:

* Allow anyone to create a new book entry
  * Books have, at a minimum, a title, author, description, and URL
* Allow anyone to update or delete a book entry
* Allow anyone to view the list of books

### Added features

If you finish all of the above, consider some of the following:

* Style your application with your own CSS by editing `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` or digging into [the asset pipeline](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html)
* Allow users to upload an image for the book with [CarrierWave](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/rails-image-upload-using-carrierwave-in-a-rails-app--cms-25183)
