# FreeShelf Day 1

## Description

During this three-day project, you will build a Ruby on Rails application to collect an index of free programming books online. This application will, after three days, allow users to look at a list of all the books, add new books, edit or remove books they've added, and checkout books.

On the first day, your application should:

* Allow anyone to create a new book entry
  * Books have, at a minimum, a title, author, description, and URL
* Allow anyone to update or delete a book entry
* Allow anyone to view the list of books

### Extra features

If you finish all of the above, consider some of the following:

* Style your application with your own CSS or Bootstrap.
* Allow users to upload an image for the book with [CarrierWave](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/rails-image-upload-using-carrierwave-in-a-rails-app--cms-25183)
