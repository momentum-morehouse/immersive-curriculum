# Intro to React: Tic-Tac-Toe

## Skills

TODO

## Directions

For your first React project, complete [the tutorial in the official React documentation](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

The tutorial walks you through building a simple tic-tac-toe game for the browser, using React components. Take your time and read the docs; the point of this assignment is to become familiar with the vocabulary and conventions of React, so the finished product is a means to that end. If you have a working game but can't explain how it works, then you have missed the point.

The tutorial will review what you learned in class today and will introduce other new concepts that you will learn more about this week. You're not expected to get it all the first time around.

Come to class tomorrow prepared to ask questions about anything that seems confusing or weird.
