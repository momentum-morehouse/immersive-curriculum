# Working with Child Components in React

## Directions

Today you'll build out a simple React application that has some starter components defined for you. The included `mockup.png` file shows you an example of the finished product: a user should be able to input text into a form, and that text should be displayed in another component after the user clicks submit.

Use `create-react-app` to generate a new React application, and use the provided starter javascript file, `react-starter.js` to build the components you will need.

You can copy the contents of this file into your `App.js` to get started. When you start it up with `npm` or `yarn`, you'll see that you will need to change it significantly to get everything working properly.

After everything is working properly, you will need to move each of the components (except for the App component) into their own separate file within src/components and import and export them properly. The App component should only render a BaseLayout and ParentComponent.

The BaseLayout component should house the Header and Footer components as well as make room for any child components that would be rendered in between.

The ParentComponent has a lot of the functionality worked out for you, but you will need to make it run properly.

 After all functionality is complete you should style your application so it looks finished.

## Extra Challenges

If you get that working, add some JavaScript to transform the text input in some way. You could return it spelled backwards, or scramble the letters randomly, or something else you think would be cool to do.
