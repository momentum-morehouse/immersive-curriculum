# Using Sass with BEM

## Directions

This project contains two starter files, `index.html` and `style.scss`. It also contains a folder, `resources/`. The `resources` folder contains screenshots of the final website at three sizes: mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Using the `index.html` and `style.scss` files, you must create the page with a responsive layout. You must use Sass and BEM when building this page. Don't edit the HTML page. You can match the mockups with nothing more than CSS, so you have no reason to edit the HTML.

You must use Parcel to build your site. You must have a `package.json` and `yarn.lock` file included with your homework. Do not commit the files Parcel builds or files in `node_modules/`, but instead commit your source files.
