Card Deck
=========

## Directions

You will create two classes, `Card` and `Deck`, that simulate a deck of cards. The deck of cards has four suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades), thirteen suits (Ace through King), and no jokers. Aces are the lowest ranked cards.

This project is not laid out like previous ones. Instead, there is a `lib/` directory with skeleton files for the classes, and a `test/` directory with the tests. There is a `Rakefile`, which is used to define commonly-run tasks for Ruby projects. Instead of running the tests via `ruby test/card_test.rb` or `ruby test/deck_test.rb` (although those will work), run `rake test` to execute all the tests.

## Files

Starter files have been provided in the 'deck_starter_files' folder. There are no methods defined. To determine what methods to define and what they should do, run the tests given.
